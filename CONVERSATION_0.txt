We built a card game prototype in Godot 4.4 with C#. Here's what we did:

1. Created a Card scene/script:
   - Visual representation of a playing card with rank and suit
   - Can be flipped between face-up and face-down states using right-click
   - Can be dragged around using left-click
   - Shows red or black text based on suit
   - Has a red semi-transparent back when face-down

2. Created a Deck scene/script:
   - Visual stack of cards that shows more card backs when more cards remain
   - Shows 1 card back per 10 cards in deck (rounded up)
   - Shows dashed border placeholder when empty
   - Left-click to draw a card
   - Has a "Clear Cards" button below it that returns all cards to deck and reshuffles
   - Uses a custom CardData struct to efficiently store card info
   - Maintains a proper shuffled deck of 44 cards (standard 52-card deck minus red face cards and aces)
   - Spawns cards to the right when drawn
   - Tracks spawned cards for cleanup

3. Created a Main scene:
   - Contains an instance of the Deck
   - Acts as the parent for spawned cards

Key implementation details:
- Cards are spawned as scenes but deck contents are stored as lightweight CardData structs
- Used proper Godot input handling with AcceptEvent() to prevent event propagation
- Implemented Fisher-Yates shuffle for the deck
- Used Control nodes with proper layout handling
- Maintained clean separation of concerns between Card and Deck functionality

The current state is a working prototype where you can:
1. Draw cards from the deck by clicking it
2. See how many cards remain via the visual stack
3. Drag cards around the screen
4. Flip cards over
5. Clear all cards and reshuffle the deck
6. The deck excludes Jack, Queen, King, and Ace of Hearts and Diamonds
